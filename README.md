### Build and Technologies 

* used the socket.io and the socket.io client dependencies 
* used the cors to enable the connection between the server and the client 
* used the socket.io admin dashboard and required its instrument 
* made a basic html starter page to see the messages 
* used the snowpack to run the client side .


### How it works 

* first u start the server by running the following command :
